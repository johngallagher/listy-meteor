* Meteor mongo has a paging thing that only shows the first few lines!!

* Weird collection stuff - Lists refers to different collections on client and server
* Need to insert stuff on the server, not the client - this isn't supported for some reason... need to use meteor.call
* 

    Deps.autorun(function(){ 
      Meteor.subscribe("this_users_lists", user_id);
    });

    without the autorun function it's not going to auto change the subscription

    update method needs $set to set only the fields we want to chnage otherwise it wipes out the other fields already set.
